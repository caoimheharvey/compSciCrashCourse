Python Exercises
----------------

To complete the exercises you will need to create your own development branch using:
```git checkout -b <branch-name>```

After completing the exercises, you should push the changes to your branch.

Before making any changes to your branch you should copy down the latest changes from the main branch 
to ensure your development branch is up to date.
This can be done by running the following from your development branch: 
```git merge master```
