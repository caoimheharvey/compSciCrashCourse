Bonus exercise for extra practice:
Source - Facebook Interview Question

 # You will be supplied with two data files in CSV format.
 # The first file contains statistics about various dinosaurs.
        Located at: files/dino_race_dataset1.csv
 # The second file contains additional data.
        Located at: files/dino_race_dataset2.csv
 #
 # Given the following formula,
 #
 # speed = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT(LEG_LENGTH * g)
 # Where g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)

 # The SQRT can be calculated by using   **0.5

 # Write a program to read in the data files from disk, it must then print the names
 # of only the bipedal dinosaurs from fastest to slowest. Do not print any other information.
