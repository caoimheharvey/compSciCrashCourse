"""
Inside the files folder within the PythonExcercises folder you
will find a comma separated file called 'employees.csv'
You will need to perform 2 tasks on the data using exception handling where appropriate throughout:
1. Create a new file called "ordered_employees.csv" which will contain all the data in employees.csv but it must be
ordered alphabetically by last name, and lowest to highest salary
2. Prompt the user to enter the following parameters and return the data for the employees that fit the category:
    - Enter a job they wish to search
    - Age Group
    - City
    - Salary Range (should accept in the format min - max)
    The user can hit enter (a blank line) which will mean they skip and provide no parameter.
    After the user input is taken it should be passed to a function which will perform the search.
    The number of the parameters for that function are unknown.
