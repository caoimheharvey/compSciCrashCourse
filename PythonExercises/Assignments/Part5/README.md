Part 5
======
Congratulate yourself on getting this far. You've passed the point of beginners Python to now begin looking at 
more advanced topics.

This project will involve:
- Creating an API using Flask
- Accessing an existing API
- Creating your own Python modules to import and leverage

You should be mindful of Object Oriented Programming practices and use classes (custom classes) where needed. 
You are advised to use Google where needed.

Project Overview
--------
You will create at least 3 files:
1. Module - An Object Oriented Class that will perform tasks and operations on a file.
2. Backend - Core logic file which will serve as your main functionality and define the endpoints for your custom API.
3. Client - Client file which will in a sequential and step by step order make calls to your custom API.
